  \caption{Winning options of COVID-19-related questions using different voting methods. This table presents the results of four COVID-related questions (columns) that were voted upon using four different voting methods (rows): majority voting ($mv={0,1}$), combined approval voting ($cav={-1, 0, 1}$), score voting ($sv={0,1,2,3,4}$), and modified Borda count ($mbc={0,1,2,3,4}$). The winning option out of ${o_1,...,o_5}$ was determined by the highest sum of scores.}
